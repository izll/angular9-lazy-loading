# Angular 9 LazyLoading Modules the Ivy way

I've been creating a lot of angular repos lately and was setting up lazy loading for the first time.  Should have been less then an hour to setup the modules and components I wanted but I kept getting errors when setting up child routes.  

In the end I forgot to consider that I was using the latest and greatest (Ivy) and that things have changed.  After a late day light bulb moment I realized my mistake and that I had wasted hours just because I had not read the documentation for the new environment I was building in.  

So... I will spend tomorrow morning reading up on Angular 9 documentation instead of trying to shoe horn more old cold into my new application. 

I also spent some time looking at different implementations of Bootstrap with Angular instead of adding all the source files myself. Still hunting for an easier solution - most tutorials point directly to the min.css file but I'm looking for scss solution so that I can still overwrite base functionality.
